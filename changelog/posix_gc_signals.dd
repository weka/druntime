Posix (excl. Darwin): Switch default GC signals from SIGUSR1/2 to SIGRTMIN/SIGRTMIN+1

As the SIGUSR ones might be used by 'system' libraries (e.g., Android
Dalvik VM or LLVM libFuzzer), while the SIGRT ones are reserved for
user-defined purposes and less likely to collide.

The used signals can still be customized with an early call to
`core.thread.osthread.thread_setGCSignals()`.
